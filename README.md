# 🌌 Starfall — A Living Galaxy Sandbox

**Starfall** is a fully procedural **3D space sandbox RPG** where players explore an endless galaxy, design and engineer ships, build civilizations, terraform planets, and reshape entire star systems.

This is not a scripted story game.  
This is a **living universe simulation**.

Every system is dynamic. Every civilization evolves. Every decision can ripple across the galaxy.

## 🌠 Philosophy

Starfall is built around **emergent gameplay** — instead of scripted events, complex systems interact to generate endless unpredictable outcomes.

You don't follow a story.  
**You create one.**
